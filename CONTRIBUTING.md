# Contributing

The goal of this glossary is to be an one-stop shop for Bazel concepts and
terminology, whether you're looking up something new, or want to confirm your
understanding or intuition.

That said, we want the explanations to be as *clear* and *concise* as possible,
preferably without circular references. It can be difficult to explain a Bazel
concept with plain English, but we can at least try!

We accept contributions in various ways:

* Suggesting new terms and explanations
* Updating current definitions
* Typo fixes
